            <h2 class="padding_top_0">A BLOOMINGDALE&rsquo;S TRAVELOGUE</h2>
            <p><strong>Cuba has always captured our imagination.</strong> Its stylish swagger and old-world charm are legend. So when we got to shoot our spring collections there, it was a Bloomingdale&rsquo;s dream come true. Here are just some of the highlights and insider tips from our time in Old Havana.</p>

            <h2>RAFAEL TREJO BOXING GYM</h2>
            <p>This 1930s gym is one of Cuba&rsquo;s oldest, most iconic boxing schools. On any afternoon, you can catch a local competition among the island&rsquo;s up-and-coming talent. On the walls hang portraits of the famous Cuban boxers Kid Chocolate and Teofilo (Cuba&rsquo;s answer to Muhammad Ali)</p>

            <h2>PALACIO DE LOS CAPITANES GENERALES</h2>
            <p>During Cuba&rsquo;s colonial days, the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales served as the governor&rsquo;s home. Now the marble entrance provides access to the Museum of the City of Havana. A mesmerizing courtyard and a statue of Christopher Columbus framed by two royal palm trees are mere appetizers for the regal palace, a striking example of 18th century Baroque architecture at its finest. Be sure to check out the Italian sculptures and the antique Venetian d&eacute;cor inside.</p>
            <p>Location: At the foot of Plaza de Armas, between Oâ€™Reilly and Obispo.</p>

            <h2>YARA THEATER</h2>
            <p>Get a ticket for the Yara, where you can catch a local flick or even see a world premiere&mdash;directors such as Pedro Almodovar and Todd Haynes have debuted films at the Yara during the International Havana Film Festival. The building is emblematic of Cuban Modernist Architecture. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find classic Cuban film posters and DVDs for sale as souvenirs.</p>
            <p>Location: The corner of Calle L and 23, in Vedado.</p>

            <h2>MALEC&Oacute;N</h2>
            <p>Like a raw, rustic version of Miami&rsquo;s Ocean Drive&mdash;but without the neon lights&mdash;Malec&oacute;n is where young couples come for their first kiss, poets find inspiration and friends drink and dance at twilight. This famous seawall faces north toward the United States, offering locals and travelers the chance to catch their breath, soak in the beauty and reflect on the passage of time. The sunset at Malec&oacute;n is not to be missed&mdash;it&rsquo;s otherworldly.</p>
            <p>Location: Ask any taxi driver for Malec&oacute;n.</p>

            <h2>PASEO DEL PRADO</h2>
            <p>A must for any visitor strolling through Old Havana, the Paseo del Prado is a magnificent street approximately ten blocks in length, from Malec&oacute;n to El Capitolio. The breezy tree-lined promenade is studded with old cinemas and theaters in disrepair, a nod to the city&rsquo;s glorious past. Young skateboarders gather here the way bohemians did back in the 18th century&mdash;there&rsquo;s just something magnetic about this place.</p>
            <p>Location: At Malec&oacute;n, walk south from San Salvador de la Punta Fortress toward Neptuno.</p>

            <h2>EL BOSQUE DE LA HABANA</h2>
            <p>Tucked inside the city is a little oasis called El Bosque (&ldquo;the forest&rdquo;), where families and friends escape from the hustle and bustle of Havana for a picnic lunch. The Almendares River runs along the side of the park, which is home to large Banyan trees, lush greenery and the Amphitheater of Almendares&mdash;an amazing concert venue smack dab in the middle of nature.</p>
            <p>Location: Calle 28 A, between 49A and 49C, Reparto Kohly.</p>

            <h2>HEMINGWAY&rsquo;S HOTEL ROOM (THE &ldquo;OTHER&rdquo; HEMINGWAY SPOT)</h2>
            <p>Though he lived 30 minutes outside the capital, you can still get a taste of Hemingway&rsquo;s literary genius at the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Old Havana. When he wasn&rsquo;t out fishing or hunting, the author wrote three of his novels there&mdash;To Have and Have Not, Green Hills of Africa, and Death in the Afternoon&mdash;in room 511, to be exact, where his old typewriter is still on display. For two CUC$, a friendly hotel guide&mdash;and expert on all things Hemingway&mdash;can answer questions about the enigmatic writer and his time in Cuba.</p>
            <p>Location: Calle Obispo #153, corner of Mercaderes.</p>

            <h2>PARQUE COPPELIA AND LA CASA DEL GELATO (THE BEST LOCAL ICE-CREAM)</h2>
            <p>Cubans have been known to plan an entire afternoon around ice cream. So, Parque Coppelia, one of the largest ice cream parlors in the world, is definitely worth a visit. Admire the historic architecture and delve into its history as you enjoy a scoop or two. Alternatively, in Miramar, La Casa del Gelato creates 16 new flavors every Wednesday and is the secret spot for local ice cream addicts. Their most popular flavors are Black Cherry Amarena and Pistachio, but don&rsquo;t miss the Rum Cantina&mdash;it was definitely our top choice.</p>
            <p>Location: Parque Coppelia: the block between Calle 21 and Avenida 23, and Calle K and L in Vedado.</p>
            <p>La Casa del Gelato: Avenida 1ra #4215, between Calle 42 and 44, Miramar.</p>

            <h2>BARBERSHOP NEAR PLAZA DE ARMAS</h2>
            <p>When your vacation stubble gets too unruly, make your way to the square at Plaza de Armas and turn the corner at Obispo. Next to an outdoor caf&eacute;, you&rsquo;ll find a hidden door that leads to a room with a chandelier and a single barber&rsquo;s chair, where you can get an authentic lather and shave from a trusted barber. If you want a little more company, try the four-seater at 303 O&rsquo;Reilly. Stay smooth.</p>
            <p>Location: Near the Plaza de Armas, on the corner of Obispo. Ask locals for the exact door.</p>

            <h2>KCHO STUDIO</h2>
            <p>A 15-minute taxi ride from Old Havana takes you to the Studio Kcho Romerillo Laboratory for Art, a major center for art and culture in the city. Created by Cuban-born artist Kcho, the studio acts as a &ldquo;non-profit cultural nucleus,&rdquo; showcasing local and international work while fostering healthy dialogue and debate for everyone. As an added bonus, it was the first place in the country to offer free Wifi, so you can knock out a few emails after a healthy dose of sculptures and paintings.</p>
            <p>Location: At the Paradero de Playa.</p>

            <h2>LA GUARIDA</h2>
            <p>We did a photoshoot in front of La Guarida&rsquo;s opulent staircase, as did Vanity Fair for a recent piece with Rihanna. It&rsquo;s also showcased in one of Cuba&rsquo;s most revered films, &ldquo;Strawberry and Chocolate.&rdquo; But La Guarida is much more than a cinematic backdrop&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of Havana&rsquo;s finest restaurants, housed inside an aged mansion, and one of Cuba&rsquo;s first &ldquo;paladars&rdquo; (a restaurant located inside a private residence). The food is stylized Cuban cuisine, serving an elevated version of traditional offerings (the ceviche is one of our favorites).</p>
            <p>Location: Calle Concordia, #418, between Gervasio and Escobar.</p>

            <h2>EL DANDY</h2>
            <p>Swedish photographer Viktor Rising and his wife, Yaneisis, own this popular coffee shop, part of the new wave of small businesses popping up around Havana. As you might expect, the coffee at El Dandy is &ldquo;muy fabuloso.&rdquo; A signature shortbread cookie accompanies each cup, but you can select small bites from an efficient menu as well. A vintage record player spins Ray Charles and reggae, giving El Dandy an ultra-cool, casual vibe.</p>
            <p>Location: Calle Brasil #401, corner of Villegas, Plaza de Cristo.</p>

            <h2>SIA KARA CAF&Eacute;</h2>
            <p>Another hip little bar and restaurant within the new sector, Sia Kara Caf&eacute; offers a fresh menu and an array of rums and whiskeys. The casual, lounge-like atmosphere and late hours make it the perfect place to gather with friends.&nbsp;Even better, it&rsquo;s located just behind El Capitolio&mdash;the famous building that once housed the seat of the government prior to the 1959 revolution.</p>
            <p>Location: Calle Industria #502, corner of Calle Barcelona.</p>

            <h2>FLEA MARKET AT PLAZA DE ARMAS</h2>
            <p>While Havana is host to many flea markets, the one at the Plaza de Armas is like no other. Here you&rsquo;ll find precious old timepieces to fill the pockets of your next Bloomingdale&rsquo;s suit, or add an authentic revolutionary pin to decorate the lapel. The place is overflowing with classic Cuban vinyl, vintage cameras and other aged treasures dating back to the mid-20th century. If you&rsquo;re looking for unique takeaways and gifts for friends and family, tell your taxi driver to hit the brakes here.</p>

            <h2>CLANDESTINA BOUTIQUE (CLANDESTINA 99% DISE&Ntilde;O CUBA)</h2>
            <p>In our never-ending quest to find the coolest new shops, we bumped into a gem of a boutique called Clandestina at Plaza de Cristo. Owner Idania del Rio is paving the way for a new generation of Cuban entrepreneurs in the business of fashion. Her popular tee shirts display slogans like,&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m in Havana&rdquo; and &ldquo;99% Dise&ntilde;o Cubano&rdquo; (99% Cuban Designed). She screenprints her tees by hand in the back of her little shop near the Plaza de Cristo.</p>
