	            	<h3>1872–A Great East Side Bazaar</h3>
	            	<p>The Bloomingdale Brothers coin the phrase, "Location, location, location," and open their first store at 938 Third Avenue. Attention-grabbing window displays feature the latest Paris fashions. Soon, window shopping becomes a popular New York pastime. </p>

	            	<h3>Bloomingdale's Predicts the Future</h3>
	            	<p>Poised at the "retail crossroads" of New York, the new store at 59th Street and Third Avenue boasts a sky carriage, (i.e., an elevator). Thirteen years later, Lyman Bloomingdale finances a young inventor's idea of an "inclined elevator" and the escalator is born. </p>

	            	<p>The IRT Third Avenue El, or elevated train, is the transportation method of choice for turn-of-the-century Bloomingdale's shoppers, so much so that billboards, beach umbrellas and comic strips all over the city (and the world) boast the popular slogan, "All Cars Transfer to Bloomingdale's." Gold footprints were embedded into the sidewalk so people would follow them off the train and into Bloomingdale's. </p>

Decked out accordingly, the store shines like a jewel from the Forbidden City.</p>
