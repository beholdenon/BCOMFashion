					<h4 class="slideTitle">Karen Millen</h4>
					<p class="copy">When we first visited Karen Millen&apos;s London atelier, we were happily surprised to see that one of her designers was hand-crafting original prints in the back. This artisanal style epitomizes a Karen Millen collection; they always incorporate the best materials and keep her design standards incredibly high. Such is the case with every piece in this exclusive capsule collection. From a little white dress to a lace-up jean and top, each piece is created with the impeccable care and style she is renowned for.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Aqua</h4>
					<p class="copy">Our goal when conceiving this collection was to make totally fresh lace looks that were as versatile as they were chic. First, we found hefty, hearty lace&ndash;these are not the dainty fabrics from yester-seasons. Then we cut surprising silhouettes (like the polo- and-lace look on the right) that could be worn anywhere from a bridal luncheon to Sunday brunch. We could go on and on about how much we love every piece, but we&apos;ll give our Fashion Director the last word: &ldquo;This is the best AQUA capsule we&apos;ve ever created.&rdquo;</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Salvatore Ferragamo</h4>
					<p class="copy">It&apos;s truly humbling to think that a fashion house as prestigious as Salvatore Ferragamo would dream up designs specifically and exclusively for Bloomingdale&apos;s&ndash;and also extremely exciting. Using our iconic black and white color palette, the Italian accessory masterminds created a one-of-a-kind ladylike top-handle bag with a crosshatch motif.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Rag &amp; Bone/JEAN</h4>
					<p class="copy">From a slinky slip dress to the perfect cropped jean in an exclusive wash, our Rag & Bone/JEAN exclusives epitomize the ever-on-trend, casual-cool vibe of the brand. We&apos;re especially proud of the exclusive tee our Fashion Director helped line up: It has not one but two types of stripes (thin in the front, bold in the back) for a totally new take on one of our very favorite spring trends.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Whistles</h4>
					<p class="copy">We didn&apos;t think it was possible to create a capsule collection that included ALL of the season&apos;s most coveted trends...until our work began with Whistles. Their exclusives include stripes, lace, all white looks, and cropped flared jeans in punchy hues that we dreamed up together at their showroom. (Per our Fashion Director&apos;s request, they made the palette &ldquo;just a little bit girly.&rdquo;)</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Vince</h4>
					<p class="copy">When we&apos;re creating exclusives with a brand as chic as Vince, sometimes we like to play matchmaker. If there&apos;s a material we&apos;re loving (in this case, croc-embossed leather), and a shape we&apos;re smitten with (a sleek messenger bag), why not set them up? We did, and the sparks flew. Alongside an incredibly sophisticated block heel sandal in neutral leather, this is perhaps our favorite exclusive Vince capsule collection to date.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Marco Bicego</h4>
					<p class="copy">Being able to work with Marco Bicego every season is like having a constantly replenished treasure chest at our disposal&ndash;there&apos;s always something shiny and new. This season, we knew our spring exclusives had to center around the earring. So after much back and forth with Marco and a lot of sifting through semi-precious gemstones, we settled on the perfect pairs: the classic Marco brushed gold leaf augmented by gorgeous turquoise and lapis stones.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Rebecca Minkoff</h4>
					<p class="copy">We have a particularly fun time creating exclusives with Rebecca Minkoff. Why? Because she literally turns dreams into realities. If we&apos;re obsessed with whip-stitching, Minkoff will create an insanely cool three-piece bag collection around that idea. Add in the season&apos;s must-have silhouettes and a swing of fringe, and this Rebecca Minkoff collab is nothing short of a dream come true.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Maje</h4>
					<p class="copy">We have a word we use around the office to describe the trends we love that are still slightly under the radar&ndash;&ldquo;microtrends&rdquo;&ndash;and not one but two of them appear on one of our favorite pieces from the Maje capsule collection. It&apos;s a structured blazer (trend one), with ruffles (trend two) at the shoulders. Like the rest of the capsule, full of pretty pinks and sweet lace, the look is flirty and feminine and perfectly poised for spring.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Aqua Jewelry</h4>
					<p class="copy">Ladies, are you listening? Because we&apos;re about to give you an earful. Gone are the days of dainty studs and subdued sparkle. According to our spring runway research, wildly decorative, fabulously dangly, and insanely chic EARRINGS are officially back. And luckily, AQUA heard this loud and clear. So pull back your hair and get ready for a moment of ear excess.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Joie</h4>
					<p class="copy">Joie has the special distinction of being the very first label we start collaborating with each season of 100% Bloomingdale&apos;s&ndash;9 months in advance, to be exact. Over this period we discuss trends, compare style notes and come up with a combined vision for the capsule. They even create one-of-a-kind prints&ndash;a few of which you&apos;ll find in this collection&ndash;just for us. Thanks to our extended process, we&apos;re already hard at work on our fall capsule&ndash;stay tuned for something equally amazing in September.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">La Mer</h4>
					<p class="copy">Due to the extensive ingredient testing that it takes to make truly efficacious skincare, it can be difficult to create exclusives in the beauty realm. So we consider this Only Ours bronzer/highlighter a true coup&ndash;and from a brand as lauded and luxurious as La Mer, no less. We couldn&apos;t be happier to offer it up just in time for spring, which, as the runways showed us, is all about healthy, glowing skin.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Tory Burch</h4>
					<p class="copy">In the spirit of this season&apos;s stripe obsession, we teamed up with Tory to put our unique spin on the trend: a collection of colorblocked bags that pays homage to the iconic pattern. The result is an ensemble of bags that's just as at home at the beach as they are in the big city. We tossed an oversized tassel onto the tote&ndash;aka a built-in bag charm, which we all agreed is the season&apos;s best accessory for an accessory.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Alice + Olivia</h4>
					<p class="copy">The spirit of 100% Bloomingdale&apos;s was embodied in our collaboration with Stacey Bendet of Alice + Olivia. Our Fashion Director had her heart set on a bright red blazer and shorts, which gave Stacy the brilliant idea of a silver sequin top for a glimpse of shine underneath&ndash;aka the perfect sexy-sharp spring look. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, she also whipped up a chic striped shift dress from the amazingly colorful fabric she used for her runway ball skirt&ndash;just for us.</p>

					<h4 class="slideTitle">Vince</h4>
					<p class="copy">It&apos;s 2016 and casualwear is king. So how do you tweak something that&apos;s already working? Easy: Dial in the details. We worked with this California label to create killer, fabric-driven pieces in silhouettes you already know and love&ndash;like a slouchy coastal blue suede shirt jacket that&apos;ll mold into a second skin as you wear it.</p>

					<p class="copy">Okay, we&apos;ll admit it...we have a little bit of an indigo obsession. So when we saw this indigo linen sport coat at Ralph Lauren&apos;s New York presentation, we jumped on it and claimed it as our own. Paired with cream-colored or dark rinse jeans, our lineup of exclusive, azure-hued pieces can get you through an entire season&apos;s worth of adventures&ndash;it&apos;s your summer uniform, sans suit.</p>

					<p class="copy">In Italy, men dress fearlessly in natural, bold colors like brown, burnt orange and gray&ndash;and look exceptionally good doing so! Our Fashion Team flew to Milan to score this spread of suiting and separates in a palette that looks especially sharp in the deft cuts orchestrated by Canali&apos;s creative consultant, Andrea Pompilio. The best thing about these unique jacket and trouser combinations? They all mix and match effortlessly.</p>

A colorblocked polo and peacock blue crewneck sweatshirt feel super modern worn underneath military jackets and with non-denim trousers. This is what layering looks like in 2016.</p>

The collection has all the inky, indigo goodness of denim, only in fresh, spring fabrics that won&apos;t weigh you down.</p>
