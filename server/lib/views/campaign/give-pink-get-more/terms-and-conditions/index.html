	 		<li>
	 			<h3>Enrollment:</h3>
	 			<p>Bloomingdale's <span class="caps">give pink</span>, <span class="caps">get more</span> Program (the "Program") participation begins when you charge the $15 enrollment fee to an eligible Bloomingdale's Credit Account ("Enrolled Account") from September 27, 2017 through October 31, 2017 (the "Program Period").   If you have more than one eligible Bloomingdale's Credit Account, only an Account to which an enrollment fee has been charged will be enrolled in the Program. Eligible purchases on multiple Enrolled Accounts may not be transferred among the Enrolled Accounts. Bloomingdale's will make a $15 donation for each Enrolled Account. The donation will be distributed among the Breast Cancer Research Foundation&reg;, The Carey Foundation and the Marisa Acocella Marchetto Foundation.  You may enroll in person at any U.S. Bloomingdale's store (except a Bloomingdale's The Outlet Store, the "Excluded Stores"), by phone at 1-800-354-3417, or online at bloomingdales.com. When you charge your $15 enrollment fee, you will accumulate Give Pink, Get More Card Value, as described below, on your Net Purchases of Eligible Merchandise made during the entire Program Period even if the purchase was made on a date before the date you charged the $15 enrollment fee.  All references to dollar amounts, including but not limited to dollar amounts of purchases, Net Purchases, or Card Value, are in U.S. dollars.</p>

Bloomingdale's has the right to reduce the Value of a Bloomingdale's <span class="caps">give pink</span>, <span class="caps">get more</span> Card if you subsequently return items for which you accumulated <span class="caps">give pink</span>, <span class="caps">get more</span> Card Value in the Program. If you return items that accumulated <span class="caps">give pink</span>, <span class="caps">get more</span> Card Value and such <span class="caps">give pink</span>, <span class="caps">get more</span> Card Value already has been spent, you agree that Bloomingdale's may charge such amount to your  Enrolled Account.
