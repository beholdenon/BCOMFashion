			<p>Over the past 12 years, Bloomingdale's&ndash;with the help of your generous donations&ndash;has contributed more than $10 million to the fight against breast cancer. Through our Give Pink, Get More program, we have supported the work and research of five doctors through a grant to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation&reg;, while funding projects through The Carey Foundation (and its Tutu Project) as well as the Marisa Acocella Marchetto Foundation (and her iconic Cancer Vixen Fund).</p>

			<p>If you have not already enrolled in Give Pink, Get More, I encourage you to do so. By enrolling in store or online, you enable a donation to the charities mentioned above while also receiving a card to use for holiday shopping.</p>

			<p>So, <strong>Give Pink, Get More</strong> and help us in our fight to eradicate breast cancer. Together we can make a difference.</p>

			<p>I wish you and your family a healthy and happy autumn and holiday season.</p>
