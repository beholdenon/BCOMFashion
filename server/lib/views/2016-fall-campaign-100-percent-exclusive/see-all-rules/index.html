			(1) Sweepstakes Overview.  “Sweepstakes Period” begins August 31, 2016 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) and ends September 23, 2016 at 11:59 a.m. ET. Sweepstakes is void in Puerto Rico and where prohibited by law.  Sponsor’s computer is the official time-keeping device for the Sweepstakes. 			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(2) Eligibility.  Open to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and D.C. who, as of date of entry, are 18 years and older. Employees, officers and directors of Sponsor, or any other entities involved in the design/implementation/conduct of the Sweepstakes, or of any of their respective parent, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, as well as members of the immediate families of such persons, are not eligible to participate or win a prize. 			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(3) How To Enter. During the Sweepstakes Period, use your smartphone to visit www.bloomingdales.com/designyourword and follow all instructions to submit an original word.  The website will produce an image of your original word in Greg LaMarche-style lettering and you must upload it and publish it to your Instagram account along with the hashtags #100percentbloomies and #Sweepstakes to receive one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes (the “Photo” or “Entry”).  The Entry must be original, unpublished and may not have won any prior prize or award.  Standard data and message rates may apply to Sweepstakes entry; check with your wireless carrier for details. Wireless service may not be available in all areas.			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(4) Entry Restrictions. Limit of ten (10) Entries per Instagram user id/person during the Sweepstakes Period, provided that each entry is of a word that is materially different than word(s) previously submitted by such person as Sweepstakes entries.  A given person may only use one (1) Instagram user id to enter the Sweepstakes. No group entries.  Use of any artifice or device to enter multiple times in violation of the preceding entry limitation, use of programmed or automated entry methods, or other acts intended to disrupt or interfere with or having such effect on the proper conduct of the Sweepstakes (or any other violation of these Official Rules) may result in disqualification, which is not Sponsor’s sole remedy. Sponsor and its designees expressly reserve the right to protect their rights to the full extent of the law. Proof of submission of an Entry (i.e., posting of Photo to one’s public Instagram account) does not constitute proof of receipt of same or proof of entry. Receipt of Entries may be acknowledged in Sponsor’s sole discretion, but – if applicable - such acknowledgment does not constitute any representation as to Sweepstakes eligibility or notice of being selected as a potential winner. In the event of a dispute as to identity of entrant, the entrant will be deemed to be the authorized account holder of the e-mail address associated with the Instagram user id used to enter the Sweepstakes. Authorized Account Holder means the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, on-line service provider, or other organization that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the applicable e-mail address.  All Photos must be in compliance with all specifications outlined in Section 3 above, Instagram’s Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. Entry will be disqualified if Photo is determined by Sponsor or its designated agency not to be the original work product of entrant. Entries will also be disqualified if Sponsor or its designated agency determine in their sole discretion that Photo comprising entry: (I) violates or infringes upon the rights of any party (including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent rights, or other intellectual property rights); (II) is inappropriate, obscene, hateful, pornographic or otherwise unfit for publication; (III) advocates the use of alcohol or drugs, acts of violence or illegal behavior; (IV) disparages or damages the goodwill and/or business reputation of Sponsor; or (V) is irrelevant to the Sweepstakes theme.  			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(5) Grant of Rights:  Entrant grants to Sponsor and its designees the non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable right and license to use, perform, exhibit, reproduce and/or otherwise exploit the Photo(s) submitted in the Sweepstakes in any manner and in any and all distribution channels, venues or media now known or hereafter devised, without further notice or any compensation to entrant. The preceding grant of rights is subject only to any rights expressly retained by Instagram as per its Terms of Use. Entrant further waives any “Moral Rights of Authors” (Droit Moral) or similar natural rights of ownership he/she may have in the Photo(s).  Entrant further agrees, upon Sponsor's request and without compensation of any kind, to execute any additional documents so as to effect, record or perfect the grant of rights contemplated by this paragraph.  			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(6) Selection of Winner.   Winner will be selected by a random drawing on or about September 30, 2016.  Odds are determined by the number of entries received. 			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(7) Prize.  Winner will receive a $1,000 Bloomingdale’s Gift Card. Terms and conditions of Gift Card apply.  Approximate Retail Value of Prize: $1,000.  
			Any expenses related to acceptance and use of prize which are not specified in these Official Rules as well as all applicable federal, state or local taxes on prize are winner’s sole responsibility. Sponsor shall report prize winner’s receipt of prize to the Internal Revenue Service via 1099 Tax Form; prize winner agrees to furnish all information to Sponsor and otherwise fully cooperate with Sponsor in fulfilling this reporting obligation. No prize substitution except by Sponsor in its sole discretion and only then for prize/prize component of comparable value. Prizes are not redeemable or exchangeable for cash. Prizes are not transferable without the express written consent of Sponsor which may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion and without liability of any kind.
			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(8) Notification.  Sponsor or its agency will notify potential winners via direct message (on Instagram).  Potential winners will have seven (7) days to respond to direct message in the prescribed manner (i.e., via e-mail to designated address) so as to remain eligible to potentially win prize.  IT IS ENTRANT’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS/HER INSTAGRAM SETTINGS ALLOW FOR SPONSOR TO POST A COMMENT ON HIS/HER PHOTO IF HE/SHE IS SELECTED AS A POTENTIAL WINNER.  Potential winner will also be required to complete, sign and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release and a Publicity Release (where lawful) within fourteen (14) days of date indicated thereon.  In the event of noncompliance with this requirement (as applicable), if a potential winner cannot be contacted for any reason or if a potential winner does not otherwise comply with these Official Rules, prize will be forfeited and an alternate winner selected as set forth above.  Because the approximate retail value of the prize is $600 or more, a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number must be provided to Sponsor for issuance of a 1099 Tax Form.  In the event of noncompliance with this or any other requirement, the non-complying potential winner will be disqualified.  		
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(9) Release. By participating in the Sweepstakes and/or accepting a prize, except where prohibited by law, winner agrees to the use of his/her name, address (city, state), likeness, photograph, other indicia of persona and/or statements made by winner regarding the prize, Sweepstakes or Sponsor for advertising/publicity/trade purposes by Sponsor and its designees, without further compensation or notice, to the extent permitted by law. Each winner further agrees to confirm such grant of rights in writing upon Sponsor’s request, without further compensation.  Further, by participating, each entrant indemnifies, releases and agrees to hold harmless Sponsor, any other entities involved in the design/implementation/conduct of the Sweepstakes,  together with the parent, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries of each and their respective directors, officers, agents, insurers, representatives, shareholders, employees, as well each of their successors and assigns, all prize suppliers, Instagram and Facebook (“Released Parties”), from any and all liability arising from or in any manner related to participating in the Sweepstakes, any Sweepstakes-related activity and/or the acceptance, receipt, possession or use/misuse of a prize. The preceding includes but is not limited to any and all liability in conjunction with any third party claim that a Photo violated his/her trademark, copyright, patent rights, or other intellectual property rights. Without limiting the foregoing, the Released Parties make no representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind regarding any prize  and  winner expressly acknowledges that: (a) use of prize is solely at his/her own risk and (b) none of the Released Parties are responsible for any defect, malfunction or irregularity of any kind with respect to Sweepstakes or the prize.	
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(10) Conditions of Participation. Released Parties assume no responsibility for late, lost, illegible/garbled, incomplete, damaged, inaccessible/blocked, unrecorded, corrupted, or otherwise defective Entries, regardless of cause and, all such entries are void. Released Parties also are not responsible for any other technical or non-technical fault in the administration of the Sweepstakes, selection of the winners, attempted notification of potential winners, or award of prizes.  Submission of Entry is solely an entrant’s responsibility. Sponsor and Released Parties also do not assume any responsibility for (a) any error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of any entry, communications to/from Sponsor regarding participation in Sweepstakes (including but not limited to prize notification) or other Sweepstakes-related materials; and/or (b) any electronic, telephonic, network, computer or other technological problems, errors or malfunctions which interfere with or adversely affect the conduct of Sweepstakes, including but not limited to filtering by Instagram or other operation of Instagram’s functionality.  Sponsor’s failure to enforce any provision of these Official Rules in any given circumstance shall not constitute a waiver of such provision. If the Sweepstakes cannot be conducted as originally planned for any reason beyond Sponsor’s reasonable control, Sponsor reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Sweepstakes and select the winners as per Rule 6 above from among all eligible Entries received either prior to and/or after the action taken by Sponsor or otherwise act in a manner that it deems, in its sole discretion, to be fair, equitable and in accordance with these Official Rules.

	</div>
	<div class="seetherules_description">
		<p>
			(11) Dispute Resolution/Governing Law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, by participating in the Sweepstakes  each entrant agrees that: (a) any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Official Rules or this Sweepstakes  shall be filed exclusively in the federal or state courts in New York, NY and hereby consents and submits to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action, waiving any right of change of venue; (b) any such action shall be resolved individually and not as part of a class action; (c) any claims/judgments/awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred and shall not include attorneys’ fees. These Official Rules and this Sweepstakes shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of choice of law/conflict of laws of the State of New York (or any other jurisdiction which would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of New York).
