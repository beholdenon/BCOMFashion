                                    <p>Over the past 14 years, Bloomingdale's has contributed more than <b>$12 million</b> to the fight against breast cancer. Every October, we raise awareness and funds through our Pink Campaign, which includes everything from exclusive products and in-store events to our Give Pink, Get More program.</p>
                                    <p>These initiatives have enabled us to support the work and research of five doctors through a grant to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation&reg;, as well as to fund projects for The Carey Foundation and the Marisa Acocella Marchetto Foundation.</p>
