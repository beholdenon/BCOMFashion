### In Store Pages:
-  ~~Use 'inStore.html' (handlebars partial).~~  All 'in-store' pages can now just put their data inside of 
the static data directory described below and it will be picked up and used by the './index.html' template.
-  ~~Ensure you have a data file with the information required for the template sitting
 within './server/lib/data/static/in-store-{YOUR-PAGE'S-PATHNAME-TAIL-HERE}.json. (
 pathname tail: last '/' separated part of pathname).
